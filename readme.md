# Bandcamp Fan Overlap Finder 

A Python tool that helps DJs and music enthusiasts discover new music by analyzing shared fan bases across different Bandcamp tracks and albums. The tool identifies users who have purchased multiple tracks from your selection, helping you find curators with similar music taste.

## Core Features
üîç Fan Base Analysis: Compare supporter lists between multiple Bandcamp tracks/albums  
üë• Overlap Detection: Find users who have purchased multiple tracks from your selection  
üîó Profile Discovery: Get direct links to music collectors' public profiles  
‚ö° Batch Processing: Analyze multiple tracks simultaneously  
üìä Simple Interface: Easy-to-use command line tool (with planned Streamlit UI)

## How It Works
- Input two to 5 Bandcamp track/album URLs
- The tool scrapes the "supported by" sections
- Identifies fans who appear across multiple tracks
- Returns a list of overlapping fans with their profile links

## Use Cases

- Labels researching active music buyers in their genre
- Artists finding potential fans based on similar music purchases
